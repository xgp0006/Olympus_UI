# Theme Loading Fix Summary

## The Problem

The theme loading was failing with "TypeError: Failed to fetch" because:

1. The fetch was happening too early before the dev server was ready
2. The SSR path was trying to fetch which doesn't work
3. Multiple incorrect paths were being tried

## The Fix Applied

### 1. Browser-Only Loading

- Added check to ensure themes only load in browser context
- Throws clear error if attempted in SSR

### 2. Initial Delay

- Added 200ms delay on first load to ensure dev server is ready
- Added 250ms delay in ThemeProvider mount to stabilize environment

### 3. Simplified Path

- Removed all the complex fallback paths
- Use only the correct path: `/themes/${themeName}.json`

### 4. Better Error Handling

- Clearer error messages
- Proper fallback to default theme

## Files Modified

- `src/lib/stores/theme.ts` - Main theme loading logic
- `src/lib/components/theme/ThemeProvider.svelte` - Theme provider component

## Testing

You can test the fix by:

1. Starting the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:1420
3. Check console - theme should load without errors

Alternative test routes created:

- `/test-theme` - Basic theme test
- `/test-simple-theme` - Simple theme loader test
- `/test-retry-theme` - Theme with retry logic
- `/test-fixed-theme` - Fixed theme provider test

The theme should now load correctly without any "Failed to fetch" errors.
