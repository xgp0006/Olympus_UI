## Code Coherence and Consistency

Olympus follows aerospace-grade standards for code coherence and consistency to ensure maintainability, safety, and reliability across the multi-crate workspace.

### Architectural Coherence

**Workspace Structure Consistency:**

- Each crate follows the same internal organization: `lib.rs`, `error.rs`, domain modules
- Public APIs are consistently designed with builder patterns and error handling
- All crates implement the same logging, error propagation, and configuration patterns
- Inter-crate communication follows the message bus pattern from `olympus-core`

**Data Flow Consistency:**

- All real-time data flows through the universal event bus (`olympus-core`)
- Configuration changes propagate through the core state management system
- Error handling follows the same aerospace-grade patterns across all modules
- Telemetry data maintains consistent formatting and validation standards

**Interface Coherence:**

- CLI commands follow consistent naming: `olympus <subsystem> <action> [options]`
- All subsystems implement the same health monitoring and status reporting interfaces
- Plugin architecture ensures consistent integration patterns for external hardware
- API responses maintain consistent error codes and message formats

### Code Style Consistency

**NASA JPL Power of 10 Compliance:**

- Functions limited to 60 lines maximum across all crates
- Cyclomatic complexity â‰¤ 10 for all functions
- No dynamic memory allocation in real-time paths
- All return values checked (no unused `Result` types)
- Consistent use of `#[must_use]` attributes for critical types

**Rust Idiom Consistency:**

- Error types implement consistent traits: `Error`, `Debug`, `Clone` when appropriate
- All async functions use `tokio` runtime consistently
- Resource management follows RAII patterns with custom `Drop` implementations
- Type safety enforced through newtype patterns for domain-specific values

**Documentation Standards:**

- All public APIs documented with usage examples
- Safety considerations documented for any `unsafe` code
- Performance characteristics documented for real-time components
- Error conditions and recovery strategies clearly documented

### Naming Conventions

**Module and Type Naming:**

- Crates named `olympus-<domain>` following kebab-case
- Types use PascalCase: `VehicleState`, `GpsDevice`, `TelemetryMessage`
- Functions and variables use snake_case: `process_telemetry`, `gps_quality`
- Constants use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE: `MAX_VEHICLES`, `TELEMETRY_RATE_HZ`

**Domain-Specific Patterns:**

- All state types end with `State`: `VehicleState`, `GpsState`, `ConnectionState`
- All configuration types end with `Config`: `MavlinkConfig`, `LoggingConfig`
- All error types end with `Error`: `MavlinkError`, `GpsError`, `ConnectionError`
- All manager types end with `Manager`: `VehicleManager`, `ConnectionManager`

### Data Structure Consistency

**Configuration Patterns:**

- All configuration structs implement `Default`, `Clone`, `Debug`, `Serialize`, `Deserialize`
- Configuration validation happens at application startup, not runtime
- Environment variable overrides follow consistent naming: `OLYMPUS_<CRATE>_<SETTING>`
- Configuration errors provide actionable error messages with suggested fixes

**State Management:**

- All state mutations go through the core message bus for auditability
- State changes are atomic and follow event sourcing patterns
- Rollback capabilities exist for all critical state changes
- State persistence follows consistent serialization patterns

**Error Handling:**

- All errors implement conversion patterns between crate boundaries
- Error context includes relevant system state for debugging
- Recovery strategies are consistently implemented across similar operations
- Error logging includes structured metadata for monitoring

### Testing Consistency

**Test Organization:**

- Unit tests in `tests/` directory for each crate
- Integration tests validate cross-crate interactions
- Performance tests ensure real-time requirements are met
- Property-based tests validate edge cases for critical algorithms

**Test Patterns:**

- All async tests use `#[tokio::test]` consistently
- Mock objects follow the same interface patterns as real implementations
- Test data generation uses consistent factory patterns
- Assertion messages provide clear failure context

### Performance Consistency

**Real-time Guarantees:**

- All telemetry processing maintains 50Hz minimum rates
- Memory allocation patterns are predictable and bounded
- CPU usage monitoring is consistent across all real-time components
- Latency tracking follows the same measurement patterns

**Resource Management:**

- Connection pooling patterns are consistent across network protocols
- Buffer management uses the same bounded allocation strategies
- Thread pool configuration follows consistent patterns
- Resource cleanup is deterministic and follows RAII patterns

### Development Workflow Consistency

**Build Process:**

- All crates build with the same compiler flags and feature sets
- Safety-critical profiles apply consistent optimization levels
- Documentation generation follows the same standards
- Dependency management uses consistent version pinning strategies

**Quality Assurance:**

- All code passes the same `clippy` rule set
- Formatting follows aerospace-standard `rustfmt` configuration
- Security audits apply to all dependencies consistently
- Code coverage requirements are uniform across the workspace

### Future-Proofing Strategies

**API Evolution:**

- Deprecation warnings provide migration paths
- Version compatibility is maintained across minor releases
- Breaking changes follow semantic versioning strictly
- Public API surface is minimized to reduce maintenance burden

**Extensibility Patterns:**

- Plugin interfaces are designed for forward compatibility
- Configuration schemas support graceful evolution
- Database migrations are reversible and tested
- Protocol implementations support version negotiation

This coherence ensures that any developer can work effectively across the entire Olympus codebase, understanding patterns and conventions that apply consistently throughout the aerospace-grade ground control system.

# Clean slate rebuild
cargo clean && cargo build --workspace

# Check specific feature combinations
./scripts/manage-features.sh check [feature_set]

# Dependency conflicts
./scripts/validate-dependencies.sh --tree
```

### NASA JPL Compliance

```bash
# Check for rule violations
cargo clippy --workspace | grep -E "(too-many-lines|cognitive-complexity|unsafe)"

# Memory allocation analysis
./scripts/validate-dependencies.sh --memory
```

### Performance Issues

```bash
# Profile specific components
cargo build --release && cargo bench -p [crate-name]

# Check real-time constraints
cargo run -p olympus-cli -- mavlink telemetry --rate 50
```

## Important Notes

- **Never** manually edit auto-generated files in `.taskmaster/`
- Always use workspace-level builds for consistency
- Test feature combinations before merging changes
- Document any unsafe code with safety analysis
- Follow NASA JPL Power of 10 rules strictly for aerospace compliance

## Current Development Status

**Development Phase:** Core infrastructure complete with Task Master AI integration
**Next Phase:** MAVLink integration implementation and advanced feature development

## Project Context

This project implements the Olympus CLI Interconnectivity System as specified in:

- `.kiro/specs/olympus-cli-interconnectivity/design.md` - Comprehensive architecture design
- `.kiro/specs/olympus-cli-interconnectivity/requirements.md` - 16 core requirements

The system provides true interconnectivity between MAVLink, ROS2, Klipper, and SDR systems with CLI-first operation, ratatui terminal interface, real-time data fusion, and deterministic behavior suitable for mission-critical aerospace applications.

This project prioritizes safety, reliability, and real-time performance for aerospace applications. When in doubt, prefer the more conservative, aerospace-compliant approach.
