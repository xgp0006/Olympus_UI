# Product Overview

## Modular Command & Control (C2) Svelte Frontend

The Modular Command & Control (C2) Svelte Frontend is a lightweight, performant, and ultra-reliable user interface for aerospace command and control operations. It serves as a pure visualization and user-input layer for a modular aerospace command and control platform, with all mission-critical logic residing in the Rust backend.

### Key Product Characteristics

- **Aerospace-Grade Reliability**: Built for mission-critical operations with comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
- **Modular Plugin Architecture**: Core functionality implemented as self-contained plugins (Mission Planner, SDR Suite, etc.)
- **Ultra-Themeable Interface**: Fully customizable UI with centralized theming engine, optimized for AMOLED displays by default
- **Real-Time Data Visualization**: Live spectrum analysis, mission planning, and telemetry display
- **Persistent CLI Integration**: Always-available command-line interface for direct system control
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Built with Tauri for native desktop performance across platforms
- **Tauri-Rust Integration**: Seamless frontend-backend communication through well-defined Tauri commands and events

### Target Users

- Aerospace operators requiring mission-critical command and control interfaces
- Mission planners creating and managing complex vehicle operations
- Communications specialists monitoring radio frequency data
- System administrators requiring direct CLI access to backend systems

### Core Value Proposition

Provides a unified, reliable, and highly customizable interface for complex aerospace operations while maintaining strict separation between UI presentation and mission-critical backend logic through a robust Tauri-based architecture.

### Critical Development Principles

- **Zero Errors, Zero Warnings**: All code must compile cleanly with no warnings or errors
- **Absolute Code Coherence**: Maintain consistent patterns across all components and modules
- **Aerospace-Grade Standards**: Follow rigorous development practices suitable for mission-critical applications
- **Future-Proof Architecture**: Design patterns that support ongoing development without breaking existing functionality
