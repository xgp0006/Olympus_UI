MAP FEATURE AGENTS - LAUNCH SUMMARY
===================================

All agent worktrees have been created. To start development:

1. LOCATION ENTRY AGENT
   Terminal 1: cd .claude-orchestrator/worktrees/location-entry && claude
   
2. MAP CROSSHAIR AGENT  
   Terminal 2: cd .claude-orchestrator/worktrees/map-crosshair && claude
   
3. MEASURING TOOLS AGENT
   Terminal 3: cd .claude-orchestrator/worktrees/measuring-tools && claude
   
4. MESSAGING SYSTEM AGENT
   Terminal 4: cd .claude-orchestrator/worktrees/messaging-system && claude
   
5. ADS-B DISPLAY AGENT
   Terminal 5: cd .claude-orchestrator/worktrees/adsb-display && claude
   
6. WEATHER OVERLAY AGENT
   Terminal 6: cd .claude-orchestrator/worktrees/weather-overlay && claude

Each agent should read their AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md file to understand their mission.

Shared code is in: src/lib/map-features/

Performance target: 144fps (6.94ms frame budget)

Good luck! ðŸš€
